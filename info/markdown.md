# Math Blocks

```
This is inline math $\sum_{i=1}^{N} i $. This is display math.

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} i 
$$

The extra empty line matters, or you will end up with
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{N} i 
$$

```
[Mathjax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html) syntax is like latex. You cannot use `\usepackge`, but you can use `\newcommand` like this 

$$
\newcommand{\NewOp}[2]{\lbrace{#1}\mid \otimes{#2}\rbrace}
$$

And `\NewOp` will be available in all later math blocks, whether inline $\NewOp{x}{y}$ or display

$$
\NewOp{x}{y}
$$

Be **very careful** with the vertical bar symbol and underscore in math. If you use it like $|x|\ge 0$, $|0|=0$, or like $\lbrace x | x\gt 0\rbrace$, you will get a bunch of gibberish.

Use `\vert` in $\vert x\vert\ge 0$, $\vert 0\vert=0$. Use `\mid` in $\lbrace x \mid x\gt 0$ instead.

Also using underscores like this $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_{c_2}^{c_3}$, with $y_{c_2}^{c_3}$, will be processed as _this_.

Wrap underscores with whitespaces like this $x _ 1$, $x _ 2$, $x _ {c _ 2}^{c _ 3}$, with $y _ {c _ 2}^{c _ 3 }$

# Images

```
Markdown use `![caption](link)` to reference pictures, caption is optional. You cannot control the size. 

![caption](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yk-liu/yk-liu.github.io/master/_posts/2018-11-01-Introduction-to-Homology/assets/triangles.png)

So I prefer using HTML tags like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yk-liu/yk-liu.github.io/master/_posts/2018-11-01-Introduction-to-Homology/assets/triangles.png" width=30%>
```

# Lists

```
- This is unordered list
  - sub item
    - subsub item
      - subsubsub item
        - subsubsubsub ...

---

- List can have multiple lines

  like this.

---

1. This ordered list

   1. sub item

2. This is as well

3. It can keep going

---

1. You can avoid numbers like this
   1. sub item
1. It keeps going
1. Blah Blah
```
